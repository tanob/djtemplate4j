# djtemplate4j - Django Template for Java

The purpose of this project is extract the core ideas from the Django template system and implement it to be used on languages that run on top of the JVM.

This is a work in progress, there is no support to blocks yet, but variables can use the dot syntax to lookup values on maps (dictionaries), objects through getters, method calls and list indexing.
